        Nike has confirmed that former president Barack Obama is in collaboration with designers in releasing a new line of basketball shoes slated to drop early next Fall. A long time fan of basketball, Obama has been vocal in his desire to drop a shoe line after exiting the White House. Current Nike CEO Mark Parker states that he is excited for the upcoming collab and is adamant that this new line of shoes will become a mainstay in the shoe industry. Obama released a statement earlier today stating that his goal is to make the shoe affordable and promised to have it manufactured within the United States. "It is imperative for every man, child, and woman to have affordable and easy access to my new shoe, the Obeezy 200." </textarea>
